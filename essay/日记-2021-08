  Sports teaches you character, it teaches you to play by the rules, it teaches you to know what it feels like to win and lose — it teaches you about life.
  体育塑造你的性格，教会你遵守规则，让你体会输赢——它教会你生活。

  Champions aren't made in the gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them — a desire, a dream, a vision.
  冠军并不诞生于体育馆，而是由其内心深处的渴望、梦想和愿景所造就。
